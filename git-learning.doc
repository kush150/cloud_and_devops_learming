what is git ? 
Git is a distributed version control system that allows multiple developers to work on a project 
simultaneously without interfering with each other's changes. It tracks changes to files and enables
collaboration, branching, and merging of code.

GIT COMMANDS 

git --version
- To check the installed version of git

git init
 - Initializec an empty git repository

git status 
- Gives the information of tha current  state of the git repository

git add <filename>
 - Adds the file to the staging area & show the tracked and untracked files

git commit -m "give massage" 
- Commits the changes to the local repository

git log
- shows the commit history

git log --oneline

concetp of git branches and creating feature brachnes!
Branches in Git are used to create separate lines of development within a repository.
 They allow developers to work on different features,

git branch 
- shows the list of branches in the repository

git branch <branchname>
 - Creates a new branch 

git checkout <branchname>
- Switch to the specified branche

git branch -M <new_name>
- Renames the current branch to the new name

git branch -d <branch_name>
- Deletes the specified branch

git merge <branchname>
 - Merges the specified branch to the current branch
 Note: - while merging branches it give an error or conflict shows there is a difference between the content of 
 branches in the same line, and denied to merge automatically. For that we need to checkout the conflict, removes
 the indecators and then commit the changes. 

git diff <branch_name>
- Shows the difference between the current branch and the specified branch to compair commits, branches, files & more.


 git restore --staged <filename>

git revert <logID>
- Reverts the changes made in the last commit 

git clone <repository_link>
- Clones the remote repository to the local machine 

git push origin main 
- Pushes the changes to the remote repository

git push -u origin main
- Pushes the changes to the remote repository and sets the upstream branch (which means we don't need to origin/main only write
  "git push" )

git pull origin main
- Pulls the changes from the remote repository to the local machine

git config --global user.name <github_user_name>
- Sets the username for git configuration

git config --global user.email <email_id>
- Sets the email for git configuration

git remote add origin <link>
- Adds the remote repository link

git remote -v
- Shows the remote repository link

git config --list
- Shows the git configuration list

github
- A web-based platform that uses git for version control and provides additional features like issue tracking, project management,
 and collaboration tools. It allows developers to host their repositories online and collaborate with others easily.
